## Moore's Vision statement


SWYL is a web-based music donation/NFT marketplace platform that is compatible with mobile devices THAT provides artists and their fans an e-performance where artists can show off their artworks and the fans can enjoy them then either tip the artists or offer to buy the digital copies of the artworks in form of NFTs. UNLIKE other platforms, OUR platform is powered on top of the Ethereum blockchain (or any other L2 blockchain networks) which means the artists can copyright their music for free, automatically receive donations from fans, be able to sell limited-edition versions of their music in form of NFTs and instantly receive royalty rewards every time their digital copies go on sale again in future. Also, blockchain technology will make all the transactions, ownerships and copyrights are transparent and immutable on the blockchain network.
