## Overview
`Spark Your Noble Story` (***SYNS***) - is a full-stack web 3.0 platform that combines a music-donation system, NFT marketplace, club membership, and social media features, all built on top of the [Polygon network](https://polygon.technology/matic-token/). The platform allows musicians to connect with their fans and share their artworks in the form of non-fungible tokens (****NFTs****). Fans can listen to the music and either tip the artists or purchase the music NFTs.

***SYNS*** offers musicians a way to copyright their music for free by turning it into `NFTs` and immutably storing them on the blockchain. This allows fans to easily donate to their favorite musicians from anywhere in the world without having to worry about currency conversions. All transactions on the `SYNS Marketplace`, including the buying and selling of NFTs, are transparently recorded on the [Polygon blockchain](https://polygon.technology/matic-token/). Additionally, artists can receive royalty rewards every time their music NFTs are sold in the future. All of this is made possible by the use of blockchain technology.
