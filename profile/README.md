<h5>Work in progress...</h5>
</p>

## Overview
`Support Who You Love` (***SWYL***) - a full-stack web 3.0 Music-Donation/NFT-Marketplace/Club-Membership/Social-Media all-in-one platform powered on top of the [Polygon network](https://polygon.technology/matic-token/) that helps musicians connect to their fanbase with ease! ****SWYL**** provides an e-playground where artists can show off their artworks in the form of Non-fungible tokens ([***NFTs***](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)) and the fans can enjoy listening to them then either tip the artists or offer to buy the music NFTs from the artists.

***SWYL*** offers musicians an easy way to copyright their music for free by turning their music into `NFTs` and immutably store them on the blockchain. Fans now can donate their favorite musicians from anywhere on Earth within seconds without involving in any frustrating currency conversion procedure. All the transactions related to buying and selling NFTs happen on `SWYL Marketplace` are transparently and clearly recorded on the [Polygon blockchain](https://polygon.technology/matic-token/). Finally, artists can also instantly receive royalty rewards every time their `music NFTs` go on sale again in future. Everything is made possible thanks to the [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
